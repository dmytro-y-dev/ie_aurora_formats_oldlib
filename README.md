Helpers to work with Inifinity Engine/Aurora
============================================

Author: metamaker

This is one of my old libraries to work with Inifinity Engine/Aurora files. Supported formats are: .2DA, .BIF, .CHU, .KEY, .TLK (v1 and v3), .TRA.

Building the library
--------------------

This library is not organized in a fashionable way: it is just a bunch of files that doesn't intended to be built.

If you want a fine way to work with .TLK and .TRA, see <https://github.com/metamaker/cppbg>.
